Covariant return type refers to return type of an overriding method.
It allows to narrow down return type of an overridden method without any need to cast the type or check the return type.
Covariant return type works only for non-primitive return types.
From Java 5 onwards, we can override a method by changing its return type only by abiding the condition that return type is a subclass of that of overridden method return type.


Advantages of Covariant Return Type
Following are the advantages of the covariant return type.

1) Covariant return type assists to stay away from the confusing type casts in the class hierarchy and makes the code more usable, readable, and maintainable.

2) In the method overriding, the covariant return type provides the liberty to have more to the point return types.

3) Covariant return type helps in preventing the run-time ClassCastExceptions on returns.
